						<h2>Honda Civic</h2>
						<h3>Rolando Toledo's 1999 EK Civic CX Hatchback</h3>
						<p>I first saw Rolando's car all the way back in August. While it's no secret that I'm not much of a Honda guy, Rolando's EK stood out in the crowd of cars at the third annual Motor Union hosted by our friends at 5 & A Dime. The wonderfully clean and simple bodywork, the fantastic choice and execution in wheels, and the overall style of his car captured my attention, leading me back to the car several times throughout the day.</p>
						<p>After several unsuccessful attempts of asking the crowds surrounding Rolando's car if one of them happened to be the owner, I finally lucked out. Someone said they knew him and would send him my way. It's a situation any automotive magazine or blog guy is familiar with; you're in, but now comes the agonizing wait for the follow up. "Will he contact me?" I wondered. It's always a gamble. There's only so much leaving your information behind can do. However, luck was on my side, and by the end of the afternoon, Rolando and I were batting around ideas on where to shoot his fantastic build.</p>
